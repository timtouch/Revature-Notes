# Presentation Tips
- Know the company you're applying for
    - Have questions for the company
    - Research your interviewer on linkedin
    - Ask about the teams and what tech they are using
- Know your skills
    - What's your greatest strengths
    - What's your greatest weakness
        - How do you try to overcome it
- Resume
    - Everything in your resume is fair game so be confident on what you put in your
     resume
     - If you don't know something, don't straight out guess, but explicitly tell them so. Give something to the effect of something related to the topic at stand.
- Make a good first impression
    - Be confident, speak up
    - Mind the words you use to describe what you've done and learned.
        - Make it sound like you enjoyed it. "I had the opportunity to..."
    - Don't make too strong of eye contact, but do make some
    - Handshake
        - Eye contact, but break it to find the hand to shake, then reestablish eye contact
-  Seating posture
    - Lean slightly forward, but not too much
    - Shows you're not lazy
- Give the amount of energy that you can take
    - Might be teamed up with people of similar energy levels
- Don't show ticks (Shaking legs for me)
- Have an open posture
- Personal distance zone
    - 3-5 feet
- Smile
    - If you can't, think of something that makes you smile. Possibly something funny.
- Look for body language of when the interviewer wants you to stop talking.
- Always be ready for a coding challenge
    - Flush out those requirements before you start coding
    - Talk aloud how you are going to accomplish this task
        - Brute force it, then talk about how you'd improve that
    - Talk about how you'd do it from a high level
        - Show the entire thing from front to back
- How did you use $TECHNOLOGY in the project?
    - Talk about what you used it for and how you used it. Talk about $TECHNOLOGY as if you are teaching it.
    - Should be able to discuss about different frameworks
- Video Call
    - Test your tools before you are getting interview to make user it's working
        - Always have a back up plan if your surrounding technology doesn't work. Laptop not working? Try your phone. Phone out of juice? Have their phone number handy and call them from a land line.
    - Treat it like it's a face to face interview
    - Ask them if the sound and video is okay
    - Have a nice, clean, quiet place to have the interview

### Tips for speaking with a full voice
- Try singing to help open up your voice
- Air in your lungs, ping pong ball in your mouth, have your words circulate (reverberate) in that area.

## Project 1 feedback for class
- Dabble more into CSS
    - Learn more about design
- Don't write you PPT as a script that you read off of
    - Use it to remind yourself of central ideas
- Sanitize your laptops. Don't show too much of your personal lives. Hide your bookmarks,
- Don't really show that much source code
- Don't show your database, that data should be reflected on the front-end
- Don't run head long into bugs
    - Walk the happy path where your program works fine
    - Showing your broken code is showing your weaknesses so focus on what does work
    - Don't say that you weren't able to accomplish the product and has given up, say that *it has not been implemented yet*, that you'll work on it later
- Be respectful of code freezes. When you code freeze, you assure that the code you pushed is working to some extent. When you continue to work on it up to the presentation, there is not guarantee that the project will work on the moment of presenting

## How to work in groups
- Organizing a group together, leading that team
- What does Enterprise mean?
    - It is corporate level large scale project.
    - Many people will be working on the code base.
- Always think *Separation of Concerns*

### Design patterns
- A known solution to a common problem
- If you all are trying to solve a problem, see if you can find a design pattern that you all can agree on
- For our project 2, make use of the Service Layer design pattern


### Code debit
*How much time would it take someone to go through your code base and fix all the bugs and all the code smells?*
- Every time you write code, you are adding to the code debit
